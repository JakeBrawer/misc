** How it works
- Essentially a cognitive computer language written in Lisp
- Assumes two types of knowledge *Declaritive* and *Procedural*
** Children and robots learn to play hide and seek
- HYPOTHESIS: A robot controlled by systems modeled after humans will be better able to interact with the robot
  - In order to comunicate effectively w a human, a robot must be able to translate it's representations into a system a human can understand
  - Robot should act naturally/as expected in a shared space
  - If we want robots to perform human tasks, it needs to be able to think like I a human
