** R practice
this makes a plot
  #+BEGIN_SRC R :file test.png :results output graphics
library(lattice)
xyplot(1:10 ~ 1:10)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:test.png]]

Defining vectors in R
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  # Defining a vec
   y <- c(1,2,3)
   # Adds one to each element
   y + 1
  # Accessing elements
  y[1]
  # Get sub vec
  y[0:2]

#+END_SRC

Plotting
#+BEGIN_SRC R
plot(sin(2,2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** The Birthday Paradox
- /k/ people in the room have random bdays
- Total number of equally likely bday assignments is $365^k$
- number of ways to assign bdays s.t. there are NO matches: $\frac{365!}{(365 -k )!}$
- Prob of one match: $\frac{\frac{365!}{(365 -k )!}}{365^k}$

  Solving this in R
#+BEGIN_SRC R 
  bday <- function(k){
  # create arithmetic sequences
    factors <- seq(from = 365,length.out= k, by = -1)
    1 - prod(factors) / (365^k)
  }

  for(k in 1:40){
    print(bday(k))
  }
#+END_SRC

Getting random samples
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  # replace = true puts number back into the mix to be sampled again
  sample(1:10, 20, replace=TRUE)
  k = 40
  counter <- 0
  reps <- 1000
  maxs <- rep(0,reps)
  for( i in 1:reps){
    bdays <- sample(1:365, k , replace=TRUE)
    maxs[i] <- max(table(bdays))
  }
  table(maxs)
#+END_SRC

* Probability <2017-09-07 Thu>
** Sample Space
   $S$ set of all possible outcomes
   - e.g. Tossing a fair coin:
     &S = {H,T}&
   - Tossing fair coin 3 times"
     &S = {HHH, THH, TTH, TTT, HTT,HHT,HTH,THT}&
     
** Event
   A set of some possible outcomes
   A subset of $S$
   E.g. of three tosses: $A = {HHH,HTH}$

** Probability Measure
   A function that assigns a probability to each even (btwn 0 and 1). Has to satisfy a number of conditions.
   If $A$ is an event, $P(A)$ dentes the probability of $A$

** Long-run frequency interpretation of probability
   Perform many independent trials ($n$), for each trial, record whether $A$ occurred

*** Law of Large Numbers
    As $ n-> \inf$ the fraction of $A's$ occurences converges to $P(A)$ 

** Equally likely outcomes
   Suppose sample space $S$ has a finite total number of elements (outcomes): write $#(S)$
   each element in $S$ has same probability
   
   Then $P(A) = \frac{#(A)}{#(S)}$

   Solving this amounts to solcing the counting problem

** Fundamental Counting Principle
   The total number of ways to perform the $k$ sequence of actions is $n_{1}*n_{2}...n_{k}$ where $n$ is the number of ways of performing each action.
*** Examples
    - Club has 25 members, how many ways are there to choose, president, secratary and treasurer?
      
      A: $25*24*23 = 13800$

    - Club of 25 people, how many ways to choose a set of 3 members?
      
      $\frac{25*24*23}{3*2*1}$
      
      Need to divide else you over count This is [[Combination]]

** Combination
   $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
