This is probably way more than you want or need.  Sorry, but believe it or not, I actually cut this down from the original. — Ken

First, an observation:  Nothing came to mind immediately — or too many things did.  The category “beautiful” is too abstract in my own mind to allow a simple and direct association to a single thing.  I could name many things that fit the bill.  Nevertheless, one remembered event did keep coming back to mind as I thought about things that I would call beautiful moments.  Apologies for the lengthy description below, but it’s necessary to explain fully why it was beautiful to me.  It is also seems important that this is not a simple association but instead a very complex memory.  Now to the memory.

It was the Fourth of July, mid 90s.  The family that owned a huge estate a few miles from the village where we live (in the lowest foothills of the Berkshires) had opened their land to the community for a celebration of the day.  We gathered together close friends and family and drove, along with a couple hundred other people, to the area they had set aside atop the tallest of the rolling hills on the estate.  The day was clear, with light fluffy clouds, light breezes, and perfect early July temperatures.  We spent the afternoon talking, eating, drinking, playing frisbee and tossing baseballs.  I remember some serious moments and intense intellectual discussions, but mostly we laughed and goofed around and had not a care in the world.  As it neared sundown and the fireworks approached, I walked to the top of the hill and sat on a log under a canopy of trees, looking west into the sunset.  As the sun went down behind the mountains across the river, the sky became that incredible muted swirl of color that paintings and photographs never quite manage to capture.  Others from our group walked up to watch the sunset.  No one spoke.  That was a truly beautiful moment, and I still remember it vividly.  

Some commentary:  I have seen hundreds of beautiful sunsets in the Hudson Valley, but this one was special.  It may have been especially colorful or unusually bright and clear, but that wasn’t what made it strike me as breathtaking (as in, “Don’t breathe, the spell might be broken”).  The fact that it came in the middle of a carefree day and that it was shared, silently, with people to whom I felt incredibly close made it stand out for me.  The fact that I knew that it was not the end of the day, that there was still fun and excitement coming, also made a difference, I think.  There was no tinge of poignancy in it, just pure pleasure in the beauty of the moment as a kind of symbol of the whole colorful, still ongoing, perfect day.  There were other, more cognitive (geeky?) parts of the experience as well — meta-thoughts about the fact that I understood what I was seeing and not just seeing it.  In short, beauty was a feature of a whole multi-sensory, cognitively layered moment, not just the visual input.

1. the "golden hour" -- when it's late afternoon and the light gets all warm and golden. 
2. what most contributes to its beauty is how it highlights different aspects of everyday scenes and items, and they only look that certain way in the golden late afternoon light. rooms look different because the warmth of the light streaming through the windows or the door or from other rooms redefines the space. some things turn different colors, like clothes or skin or hair. And the most beautiful part is that it's familiar because you've seen it on similar days before, but it's temporary because it's only an hour (sometimes two) before it's gone. So you long for it and the room afterward feels so much less warm. 
3. When I perceive something beautiful I can feel a range of things. Oftentimes, I feel that the beautiful thing is "a lot." I know this is vague. Another thing is usually I'll feel a sensation of some type of release somewhere in my body. Helpful comparisons: it's like the feeling of a muscle relaxing, or feeling the sun come out of the clouds and onto your body, or a blocked-off channel opening, or a hug when you didn't realize you needed one.... This is always a powerful feeling, but not always a pleasant one because it can hurt a lot. but these embodied feelings tend toward connectedness and openness. After an experience of beauty I am more open.

1. Autumn
2. Autumn is the season that is most transient: things are falling in autumn and steadying in spring, at least, so it seems more palpable. It is colorful and orange is my favorite color. It contains the slowing down of winter but also makes you anticipate the speeding up of summer. It is many things in one, but also good enough to stand on its own. And it contains subgroups of beautiful things.
3. It's the feeling you get when you remember there is more to the world than you realized

Transience ^

1. smiles
2. Well, now that I think about it, it may not be the actual aesthetics of the smile, because actually, mouths are kind of gross. And I think smiles are only perceived as beautiful in the context of a face, because taken out of context, they don't hold the same weight. What I find beautiful about a smile is the impetus behind it, the emotions and feelings that a smile is infused with.  
3. It depends on the type of beauty. When I see someone smile, I smile also. This is I think because human beauty is of a different kind. It incites empathy. So it's not only the experience of perceiving something beautiful when you are looking at a human being, but also the experience of empathy entwined with the aesthetic of beauty. When I perceive an object or an environment that is beautiful, I feel more like my breath has been taken away, like my heart is further up in my chest, and excitement. And again, these sensations change depending on the nature of the beauty, whether it's an architectural beauty, a vast beauty, a cute beauty, etc.

1. the short story "The Little Prince"
2. I find the fond memories attached to reading that with my parents at a young age beautiful. 
3. If it is something like a fond memory then I feel warmth. 

Sorry about the late response.

1. I have a beautiful old analog camera that was my grandfather's. 

2. I guess the fact that it's such a well-made machine: it's heavy, strong, and very satisfying to use. It also looks nice just from a purely visual/superficial perspective too. Lots of glass and metal. 

3. It really depends on what kind of thing it is. If it's art, I guess it's more of an emotional thing, like I feel very drawn to it. If it's something like the camera I was talking about, it's more like a sense of satisfaction or completeness, like I have this thing which is just really good at what it does, and that feels beautiful to me. I really appreciate good design, so a lot of the time those are the things I find beautiful.

1. I'm imagining myself standing on top of a hill or mountain, looking across a rural countryside, with hills and mountains in the distance, and way too many trees to count. I can hear the wind and perhaps some birds, but nothing more. 

2. To me, there are a few things that make this beautiful. The first is the natural beauty; I find the sight of forests and mountains (and nature more generally) very beautiful. Secondly, nature is quiet yet very alive; this humble vivacity is something that I find very beautiful.

3. Beauty, including beauty in nature, makes me feel at peace with myself, yet also slightly excited (or stimulated?). While I'm certainly calm when I'm doing something like surfing the Internet, there isn't that same level of warm sense of peace that I get when I see something beautiful.

Hello,

Many apologies for the lateness!! now i owe YOU the food and wine! 

1. I am sitting here in the morning staring at the trees, so my inclination is to say trees. 

2. The way it feels like the tree is something so much bigger than you (both in size and in time/age and purpose) but it can still get on  your level and offer you such a pleasant environment: shady, light filled, a nice green aura. Aside from the tree example, I guess that quality of 'feels bigger than me' contributes a lot to whether I perceive something as beautiful. Like Beyonce's Lemonade. Its visually and audio-wise stunning, but it's that sense that there's also so much more, so many more truths behind it that makes it beautiful to me. 

3. I would say I perceive a calmness within me, like everything slows down and I just really have to take in whatever this beautiful thing is. Sometimes also kind of an ASMR sensation, not so much the tingling aspect but a slight euphoria where my head feels lighter and freer than before. 

Sorry if those answers are too odd,
<3

Solitary tree in the center of a massive field 
Every tree is imperfect. A tree’s history changes it, irrevocably. If the light shifts, if the vegetation around it dies, if it loses all its branches, the tree will adapt and continue to grow. The tree’s history shapes its form. The tree’s experiences are not good or bad, each experience is simply woven into its being, seamlessly. You can look at the tree and see its life. 
I think the field image came to mind because for me to find something truly beautiful I have to feel for it, project myself onto its experience. I t
 I get a tingling sensation that propagates through my body. It starts in my upper arms, eyes and thighs and travels towards my extremities.

1) For a fair amount of NY city blocks, buildings lie only along the perimeter of the block itself, leaving the  majority of the central part of the block relatively open. Most commonly, these spaces are used to hide fire escapes and other emergency exits and so act as sort of vomitoria for would-be escapees. However, sometimes, but not always, these spaces are more like strange peaceful, urban courtyards, lush with foliage you wouldnt normally find outside of Central Park. I love these spaces a lot. Generally, adjacent buildings are flush, so these space are completely hidden from the street level. However, every once in a while, perhaps on a side street, there will be a gap between two buildings and I'll be able to glimpse into these mysterious spaces. I find these glimpses to be very beautiful.

2) One aspect of the beauty I think has to do with the mystery. The fact that I never really ever get to see these spaces fully, and never will, frustrates me but also adds to the beauty experience. They are kind of like these tranquil, pocket worlds hidden away around the city. I like that these places can exist in a place as populous as NYC. There is also an aesthetic aspect as well. The contrast between the pretty foliage and the urban surroundings is striking.

3) Tingling in my face/upper back. Tightening in the chest.

1. The night sky
2. It's vastness, how much of it is unknown. Plus stars = twinkly lights and sparkles. Can't go wrong with shiny things.I think the fact that  it is natural contributes to its beauty. 
3. Awe. Beautiful things instill a sort of wonder, happiness too, but mostly it is awe-inspiring. I feel an overwhelming tingly sensation when I see something beautiful, it usually enraptures the whole body, but we can also simply emote it with a smile.

Sunlight. Especially sunlight on things.
At first I wanted to say I think sunlight is beautiful because it’s the absence of dark. But I don’t think that’s actually why. For one thing, I can sometimes find darkness beautiful, too. What makes beams of sunlight like the ones I see out a window beautiful is how powerfully positive, warm, and smile-like they seem -- remind me of lounging around, sunning myself (like a reptile, is the phrase that came to mind) and feeling at peace. 
I can sometimes feel the smile coming on. But more often I feel the warmth of sitting in the sun.

1) the blooming trees
2) that they are rare and delicate and represent life
3) a growing light feeling in my chest

1) Winged Victory (sculpture from Hellenistic period), Hagia Sophia (building), some crushes
2) While all of these have tremendous symmetry, there is also--objectively--some slight imperfections that somehow contributes to its beauty. 
3) For lack of a better word, a fixation? I want to keep looking and examining it.  I guess I feel a certain tranquility?

 really like when it snows, and everything outside is covered. 

I think that the consistency of everything being covered with by the same color makes things beautiful. I also l think  the unexpected shapes that arise for the snow make things beautiful. 

I tray to stop for a bit and appreciate it. Sometimes I take photos, but for the most part I try to create a mental footnote. I look around and try to appreciate what is around me.
